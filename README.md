The application revolves around managing Student objects and also includes a small bank simulation to demonstrate thread safety.File NameDescriptionKey Concepts DemonstratedStudent.javaThe core entity class for a student. Implements Serializable for persistence and Comparable for sorting by marks. Overrides hashCode() and equals() for use in collections like HashSet.OOP (Attributes, Methods, Constructors), Comparable, Serializable, hashCode(), equals()StudentManagementApplication.javaThe main application driver. Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for student management operations using an ArrayList.List (ArrayList), Iterator, Collections.sort, Exception Handling (try-catch), Custom ExceptionStudentNotFoundExceptiont.javaA custom checked exception used when a student cannot be found by their roll number.Custom Exception, Exception HandlingDemoHashCodeEquals.javaDemonstrates the behavior of HashSet when adding Student objects, relying on the overridden hashCode() and equals() methods in Student.java.Set (HashSet), hashCode(), equals() contractDemoSerialization.javaWrites a Student object to a file (students.txt) using Serialization.Serialization (FileOutputStream, ObjectOutputStream)DemoDeserialization.javaReads and reconstructs a Student object from the file (students.txt) using Deserialization.Deserialization (FileInputStream, ObjectInputStream)MyThread.javaExtends the Thread class to create a new thread and demonstrates basic multithreading operations like start() and setting thread names.Multithreading (Extending Thread), run(), start(), Thread.currentThread()MyRunnable.javaImplements the Runnable interface to create threads. Shows thread creation using both an explicit Runnable object and a Lambda Expression for a concise implementation.Multithreading (Implementing Runnable), Lambda ExpressionsFunctionalDemo.javaDemonstrates the use of standard Functional Interfaces from the java.util.function package (Predicate, Function, Supplier, Consumer).Functional Interfaces, Lambda ExpressionsDemoProcessing.javaShows basic stream-like processing on an ArrayList using an explicit for-each loop and the forEach() method which accepts a Consumer.ArrayList, forEach (Consumer)Account.javaThe entity class representing a bank account. Its withdraw and deposit methods are declared as synchronized to ensure thread safety when multiple threads (like Wife and Husband) access the shared balance.Synchronization, Thread Safety, OOPBankApplication.javaThe driver class that creates an Account and two separate threads (named "Wife" and "Husband") that concurrently try to withdraw and deposit money, respectively, to demonstrate thread-safe operations.Multithreading, Runnable (using Lambda), Concurrency🚀 How to RunCompile: Compile all the Java files. Assuming the package structure is set up (org.ycpait.studentmanagementpp.entity, org.ycpait.studentmanagementpp.exception, and org.ycpait.BankApp.entity), you would compile using:Bashjavac Account.java BankApplication.java Student.java StudentNotFoundExceptiont.java MyThread.java MyRunnable.java FunctionalDemo.java DemoProcessing.java DemoSerialization.java DemoDeserialization.java DemoHashCodeEquals.java StudentManagementApplication.java
Run Main Application: Execute the student management application:Bashjava org.ycpait.studentmanagementpp.StudentManagementApplication
Follow the CLI prompts to register, display, search, delete, and sort students.Run Bank Demo: Execute the bank application to see synchronization in action:Bashjava org.ycpait.BankApp.BankApplication
Run Other Demos: Run the specific demonstration files to see various concepts in action:Bashjava MyThread

✨ Notable Features and ConceptsSynchronization and Thread Safety: The bank application demonstrates how the synchronized keyword is used on the withdraw and deposit methods in Account.java to prevent race conditions when multiple threads modify the shared balance.Collection Management: Uses java.util.List (ArrayList) to store and manage student records.Sorting: Demonstrates natural ordering (by marks using compareTo) and custom ordering (by name using a Lambda Expression in Collections.sort).Custom Exception: Handles errors gracefully when a student is not found by throwing and catching StudentNotFoundExceptiont.Data Persistence: Uses Serialization to write a Student object to a file for later retrieval via Deserialization.Multithreading: Illustrates two ways to create threads: by extending Thread and by implementing Runnable.Functional Programming: Showcases modern Java features using Lambda Expressions and the four main built-in Functional Interfaces.
